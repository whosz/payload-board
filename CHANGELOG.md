## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **SteamGridDB background art** — each app tile can display game artwork as a background (dark overlay preserves readability); pick art via the new SteamGridDB picker in the app editor (search game → pick grid image); API key configured in Settings
- **Local background image** — "Local image..." button in app editor lets you pick any image file as tile background
- **List view** — toggle between grid (cards) and list (compact rows) via grid/list icon buttons on the right of the sort bar; list rows show status LED, name, path, delay badge and all process controls in a single 44px row
- **Profile emoji & description** — emoji picker (75 icons) and optional description field in profile editor; emoji displayed in sidebar before profile name
- **Browse installed apps** — "Installed..." button in app editor opens a searchable list of apps read from Windows registry (`HKLM/HKCU Uninstall`); Windows only, returns empty list on other platforms
- **Edit profile** — pen icon appears on hover next to each profile in sidebar; opens profile editor pre-filled with name, emoji and description
- **API key save feedback** — Settings SteamGridDB section shows "API key saved." or "Failed to save API key." after pressing Save

### Fixed
- **App editing** — editing an existing app no longer creates a duplicate; dialog shows "Edit Application" / "Save" when editing, "Add Application" / "Add App" when creating
- **Error message in crashed tile** — when `start_app` or `restart_app` fails, the error is shown in red inside the tile below the path (in addition to the toast)
- **SteamGridDB API key** — key now persists correctly across restarts (was silently discarded due to incorrect store serialization)
- **App tile light mode** — tile text is always readable when background art is set; colors are pinned to dark values regardless of active theme

### Changed
- App tile control buttons have a semi-transparent dark overlay behind them when a background image is loaded
- Remove button on app tiles is now gray by default, turns red on hover
- Trash icon replaces X in both app tile remove button and profile delete button
- Confirm modal added before removing an app from a profile
- Executable path now sits immediately below app name in the tile (no large gap)
- Settings config path shown as a full readable block (click to open in file manager)
- Removed "Icon" section from Add/Edit Application dialog (auto-detection was unreliable)
- Removed auto icon detection entirely (`extract_icon` / `extract_app_icon`); custom icon files still supported
- README: removed Platform notes table, restructured Installation into Windows (ready to download) vs macOS/Linux (build from source), added simracing inspiration note

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- IPC args were snake_case (`profile_id`, `entry_id`) — Tauri 2 requires camelCase (`profileId`, `entryId`); all process commands now work correctly
- "Run Sequence" button had no `onClick` handler — now iterates sorted apps, respects `launch_delay_ms`, skips already-running apps

### Added
- App icons: auto-detected from XDG icon theme (Linux), adjacent image files (Windows/macOS); custom image picker; 20×20 icon shown on tile
- Sort bar above tile grid: A→Z / Z→A toggle (click active to reset to manual order)
- Hover states on all header buttons (Add App, Run Sequence, End Session, Settings)

### Changed
- About section: removed email, kept GitHub link only
- CI: portable `.zip` added to GitHub Release alongside installers; bundle targets narrowed to `["nsis", "msi"]`

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Settings panel** (gear icon, top-right): four sections — Appearance, Storage, Danger Zone, About
- **Light mode** — toggles `body.light` CSS class; preference persisted in `localStorage`; all hardcoded hex values replaced with `var(--color-*)` throughout every component so the theme cascades automatically
- **Confirm delete dialog** — modal confirmation before a profile is removed
- **Storage section**: shows current config directory, button to open it in the file manager, "Change directory" folder picker that migrates all data to the new location, "Reset to default" button
- **Danger Zone** — "Reset all data" with inline double-confirmation
- **About section** — app version (read from Tauri), creator contact, repo link
- Rust commands: `get_data_dir`, `get_profiles_dir`, `pick_config_dir`, `set_profiles_dir`, `reset_all_data`, `open_profiles_dir`
- `store.rs` now supports a custom profiles directory stored in a separate `payload-board-settings.json`; effective path resolved dynamically on every load/save

## [0.2.5] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- Delete profile button: red X appears on hover next to each profile in the sidebar; errors surfaced as toast

## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- Sidebar still rendering at 20px: in react-resizable-panels v4, a bare number in `defaultSize`/`minSize`/`maxSize` is treated as **pixels** (not %). Changed to string format: `"20%"`, `"12%"`, `"40%"`, `"80%"`

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- Sidebar resize fully broken: replaced shadcn `ResizablePanelGroup/Panel/Handle` wrappers with direct `Group/Panel/Separator` imports from `react-resizable-panels` — Tailwind classes on the shadcn wrapper conflicted with the library's internal inline styles, causing wrong initial size (~37px instead of 20%)
- Removed unused `faCircleSolid` import in AppTile (TS error)
- Fixed TS error: `style` prop not supported on `<Icon>` — crashed icon animation wrapped in `<span>` instead

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- Sidebar resize in both directions: reverted wrong `direction` prop → correct `orientation="horizontal"` (react-resizable-panels v4 TypeScript API)
- Sidebar content wrapped in `overflow: hidden` container so it can shrink below content intrinsic width
- ResizableHandle JS event handlers removed (were potentially blocking library's internal drag events); hover now handled via pure CSS `.resizable-handle:hover`
- Sidebar `minSize` relaxed: 14% → 12%; `maxSize` raised: 35% → 40%

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- Sidebar resize broken — `orientation` prop changed to `direction` (react-resizable-panels v4 API)
- All IPC calls (start/stop/restart/open/remove) now wrapped in try/catch; errors surfaced as dismissible toast notifications in bottom-right corner
- `End Session` button now catches and displays errors
- `.claude/` directory added to `.gitignore` to prevent local settings (and tokens) from being committed

### Changed
- Base font size: 14 px → 16 px
- App tile: 260×120 px → 340×170 px; padding 12 px → 14/16 px; icon size 11 px → 14 px
- Sidebar: profile items padding increased; `+ New Profile` button has hover background state
- Top bar: min-height 44 px → 56 px; buttons bumped to `size="default"` (from `sm`)
- Status bar: min-height 32 px → 44 px; letter-spacing added
- ResizableHandle: 1 px → 4 px, yellow glow on hover so it's discoverable
- Profile list items: hover background state added; active border 2 px → 3 px
- Tile buttons: `.tile-btn` CSS class — 60% opacity at rest, 100% on hover, scale(0.88) on press

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added

**Phase 2 — Process Control**
- `start_app` / `stop_app` / `restart_app` / `open_path` / `stop_all` IPC commands
- `ProcessManager`: in-memory PID tracking with `Running / Stopping / Stopped / Crashed` states
- 1 Hz background watcher — detects crashed processes and emits `process_status_changed` events
- PID re-adoption: after `start_app`, scan process list for 10 s to handle launchers that re-exec (Steam-problem)
- Graceful shutdown → force-kill after 5 s timeout on all platforms
- `PlatformAdapter::open_path` — Explorer `/select` (Win), `open -R` (macOS), `xdg-open` (Linux)
- Windows `graceful_close` via `taskkill` without `/F` (sends WM_CLOSE to windowed apps)
- `AppTile`: ▶ ■ ↻ 📁 controls + status LED (cyan glow / outline / red pulse for Crashed)
- `StatusBar`: live TOTAL / ALIVE / CRASHED counters
- `End Session` button wired to `stop_all`
- `sysinfo = "0.32"` + `tokio` added to Rust dependencies

### Changed
- Bundle ID: `com.matt.payload-board` → `com.payload-board`
